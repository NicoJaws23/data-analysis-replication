## Methods from LaBarge et al. 2002

Daily Covariates set to 24 hour lag (except for food availability and rainfall)

Compared 4 basic model types against a minimal model, included information on time of collection to offset changes, time from collection to extraction, total time extract was stored before transport (included in all models)

Model 1: Fruit, seed, and leaf availaility as fixed effects.

Model 2: Lowest and highest daily (24hour) temp

Model 3: Interaction between rainfall and season

Model 4: Fixed effect for whether the group had been followed the previous day (binary yes or no)

Each model included individual ID as a random intercept, compared models with and without random slopes to allow for variation between individuals. Resulted in 8 total models for 4 distinct hypotheses and a 9th minimal model.

Used models with Skew Normal Distributions and log links run in the stan computational environment, accessed through {brms}

All models used default Student-t priors (df = 3, mean = 0, scaling factor = 10)

Used Pareto smoothed importance samling leave-one-out-cross-validation to compare candidate models
